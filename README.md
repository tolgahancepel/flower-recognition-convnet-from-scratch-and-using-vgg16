# Flower Recognition ConvNet from Scratch and Using VGG16
### About
I have been studying on ConvNets and its implementation in Keras. Also my passion is to get experience about structuring computer vision projects. The best way of learning is, as you know, practice. You can find an end-to-end computer vision project (except of collecting data) in this repository. There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks: <br>

#### Flowers Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
- The dataset contains 4242 pictures of flowers.
- The images are divided into five classes: dandelion, tulip, rose, daisy, sunflower.
